#CalorieBuddy - Calorie Deficit Recipes Webapp

[Here is the website](https://calorie-deficit.netlify.app/)

When trying to lose weight, gain weight or maintain, being able to control the amount of calories you eat is important for working towards your goal. Additionally, it's important to get nutritious meals where you can track your macronutrients(fats,carbs and proteins). 

This webapp that I built allows you to do just that. It leverages the spoonacular API and so is able to generate a mealplan for the day that meets caloric goals, and provides detailed recipes. It also displays useful information like average preparation time. Additionally it caters to a wide variety of diets, such as vegetarian, vegan, pescetarian and keto.  All the user needs to do is input their target calories in the first input box, then select their dietary restrictions if any apply. Finally, clicking the generate button yields results.

This idea was inspired by my grandmother, who always jokes to me about not knowing how to lose weight, so she eats her chocolate. I explained the concept of a calorie deficit to her, and she understood, but the idea of figuring out how to track calories so rigorously to ensure she was under was daunting. That's why I'm happy to share this app with her, so she can have meals cooked for her and lose weight like she wanted!
